# Citadel APAC Datathon - The Data Open2021

### Motivation
**Home Team Advantage (covered by Tsun Wang Sau) :** What is the home team advantage? Put it simply, it is the idea that the team playing on their home turf has an unseen advantage in helping them win the match. Is it a myth? Well, through our study we shall visit if that is indeed the case and if it has a place in aiding us to predict the outcome of a match.

**Playstyles (covered by Derek Ng Wei Kang) :** In the big leagues, it is undeniable that the skill level of each team is very high, however, which of the team attributes are the game changers in terms of a team’s win and losses? Finding that out will aid in our choice of feature variables to predict a matches’ outcome.

**Hot Hand Fallacy (covered by Siddhant Pathak) :** The success of various football clubs varies over years and is dependent upon a lot of factors such as squad formation, team chemistry, and various other attributes. These are influential factors in determining the winning streak of a team, which in turn is directly proportional to the number of goals scored as well. Is there a way that, given previous seasons’ data and statistics, can we base a Machine Learning model and train it in such a manner that it can predict upcoming seasons’ status?

**Prediction from betting websites (covered by Tsz Hin Koon)** : If we believe that the sports betting market is efficient, the betting odds should somehow tell us how people think of the market, i.e., the expected win rate of each team. But how accurate are these predictions? Can these help us to build a prediction model to predict the outcome?

### Dataset Source:
Datasets were provided by the competition organizers and are named as follows: 'league.csv', 'match.csv', 'player.csv', 'player_attributes.csv', 'team.csv', 'team_attributes.csv'. 

To improve our analysis, an additional dataset was acquired from Kaggle: Football Matches of Spanish League by Rocardo Moya

### Procedure
Our team prepared four models: Time Series (to predict the number of goals scored in the upcoming seasons), Classification Models (to predict betting odds), Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization techniques to look for influential factors affecting a team’s overall performance. Our team did not grab any position, unfortunately. But it was overall a good opportunity for me to learn new things and get more and more involved in Data Science. 

### Authors and acknowledgment
This project was created by the members of team 2, namely, Siddhant Pathak, Tsun Wang Sau, Tsz Hin Koon and Derek Ng Wei Kang.

I express my gratitude and thanks to Professor Dr Sourav Sen Gupta, whose constant support and guidance made this project possible.
